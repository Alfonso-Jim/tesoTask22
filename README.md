  ### In this app I used styled components form MUI and the classic CSS was generated by locofy a tool that tuns figma designs into code.

  ### Interesting things 💻👾
  - The project is deployed [here](https://stupendous-baklava-969b08.netlify.app/), make sure to check it out. This is a build version of the project 😉 thanks to babel and webpack. Shoutout to netlify as well.
  - if you want to run the project locally clone it and run npm i and then npm start, feel like running some tests? then run npm test.
  - Let me know if you can find any other features/things that you found interesting.
  - If the requests are too fast you can use the redux chrome extension to control the states of the store.
  - This project was built with Redux Toolkit! further info (about languages) on the repository page.
  - This is an SPA app that handles navigation with react-router-dom.
